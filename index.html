<p>Skyrim, the northernmost province of Tamriel, is a cold and mountainous region also known as the Old Kingdom, Mereth, or the Fatherland, or Keizaal in the dragon tongue.
  Many past battles have given it a ravaged appearance and many ruins.
  Though currently inhabited primarily by Nords, the Elves who they replaced had resided there since time immemorial.
  The sovereign, the High King of Skyrim, is chosen by the Moot, a convention of jarls.
  A jarl is a regional ruler chosen through heredity and, rarely, through right of arms.
  The High King typically rules until death, though acts of dishonor, particularly the appearance of cowardice, can lead to the recall and reconsideration of the Moot.
  Since the Pact of Chieftains was signed in 1E 420, the Moot does not give serious consideration to anyone but the High King's direct heir unless one is not available.</p>
